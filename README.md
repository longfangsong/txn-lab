A frontend tool for visualize transaction handling process, based on the txn model of TiKV. 

This project should work as 

- The best tutorial for TiKV's transaction system.
- A tool to construct different plots of requests, and predict the result.
- A code generator for generating test code for TiKV.
- A tool for visualizing real-world transation processes in TiKV and other transactional storages.
